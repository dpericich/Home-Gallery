# Home Gallery

## Goal
The goal of this app is to create an AR experience that anyone can use to turn their living room, building wall or even a real gallery into a space to show pictures. This app will be marker based to "anchor" the pictures to specific places.

The Proof of Concept will be a simple app that allows you to scan an item and display an image over that item.

## Mobile App
This app works best if you have can print off the markers, but I have added the markers in a CSS grid format on the 'gallery/html' page. Here you can scan the marker to see what will be displayed. 

The url for the main [site](https://dpericich.github.io/Home-Gallery/) will allow you to access the gallery with all the markers, and a tours page which will access the camera.

## Setup Locally
Pull down the latest version of this repo and start a branch locally. (Check back in after I find if this works)
